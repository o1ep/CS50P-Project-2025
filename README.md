## random_qoute_manager
Is a Python-based command-line application designed to store, organize, and display quotes on a monthly basis.
The project aims to provide users with a simple tool to collect their favorite quotes and receive daily inspiration.
Quotes are organized into CSV files, with each file corresponding to a specific month of the year.
This structure allows users to maintain a chronological record of their quotes and ensures easy retrieval of quotes relevant to the current month.
The application is lightweight and requires only Pythonâ€™s built-in libraries, making it accessible and easy to run without installing additional packages.
Users can add new quotes, view a random quote for the day, or receive a helpful message if no quotes exist for the current month. The program also gracefully handles empty inputs and missing CSV files, preventing runtime errors. 

## How to Use
1. Run the program
2. Choose an action: a to add a quote and r to view a random quote
